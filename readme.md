## Rules
1. If you want to add a library, tell the lead first!
2. You can work together to build a function with your friend to help you build your feature
3. Push to your own branch, and create your own branch by format
   ```
    YOUR_NICKNAME:YOUR_FEATURE
   ```
4. Be consistent! Always compare your solution to others if their code is
   - Shorter than yours
   - Much simpler to read than yours
   - Prone to bug than yours

## Bug hunt! 
1. You can ATTACK your friend by telling which line of code that will prone to bugs
2. Remember! Our enemy is bugs! If their solution is different but it gets the job done without bug, DON'T EVER COMMENT IT
3. Every ATTACK will count in leaderboard (in this readme)
